SteamCMD GUI allows the user to use [SteamCMD] (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) on Windows without command lines and/or batch files using a very simple and intuitive graphical interface.

Also, can be used to run servers with parameters (srcds.exe), open and edit files like MOTD and maplist with a few clicks without browser on all the directories.
